# Quantum-Based Agriculture and Crop Rotation

## 🌾 Overview

This project presents a **quantum-enhanced decision-support system** aimed at improving agricultural productivity through optimized crop selection and intelligent crop rotation. By integrating **quantum computing algorithms** with **machine learning models**, the system offers predictive insights for small-scale farmers to make data-driven decisions.

### 🎯 Objective

To assist farmers in selecting suitable crops and rotation strategies by analyzing:
- Soil health
- Weather patterns
- Historical crop yield data

Utilizing **Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** and **Random Forest**, the system enhances crop yield predictions and soil sustainability.

## 🚜 Key Features

- ✅ Predicts best current-season crop using quantum optimization.
- 🔁 Suggests next ideal crop to improve yield and maintain soil health.
- 🌱 Provides soil fertility and weather-based recommendations.
- 📈 Forecasts yield with hybrid ML-quantum models.
- 🧑‍🌾 User-friendly web interface (responsive and multilingual).
- 🔄 Continuous learning from real-time user feedback and data.
